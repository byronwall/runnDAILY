<h5>Route List</h5>
<p class="icon">The left panel contains a list of your routes. This list can
be sorted using the drop down selector located directly above the list. To
reverse the sort order, select either <img src="/img/icon/sort_asc.png" /> <span
		class="bold"
>ASC</span> or <img src="/img/icon/sort_desc.png" /> <span class="bold">DESC</span>.
There are two links for each entry inside this list as well. If you would like
to preview a route, select <img src="/img/icon/arrow.png" /> <span class="bold">Show
in Place</span>. Selecting the <img src="/img/icon/route.png" /> <span class="bold">Route
Name</span> will take you to a new page that contains more detailed information about
the route, including a list of training items associated with the route.</p>

<h5>Route Preview</h5>
<p class="icon">The map included on the right serves several purposes. Upon
loading, it will be centered upon your most recently created route. An icon will
be included at the starting point of each of your routes. If you would like to
preview a route, simply click on its starting point. Once a route has been
loaded into the preview pane, it can be unloaded by selecting <img
		src="/img/icon/arrow_back.png"
/> <span class="bold">Return</span>.</p>
