<h5>What is runnDAILY?</h5>
<p>runnDAILY is a dashboard for anyone that runs, walks, bikes, or jogs. We
provide a very unique set of tools that allow a user to completely track their
personal exercise activity. The most powerful of these tools is a mapping
utility that can plot a variety of routes. In addition to the routing utility,
there are numerous other features that allow a user to track past activity and
record times for daily workouts. These features are provided inside an
intuitive, easy to use interface that's built on a social network of fellow
runners. The social networking aspect of runnDAILY allows users to interact with
one another by sharing routes and training activities.</p>

<h5>Who is runnDAILY?</h5>
<p>runnDAILY was created by a pair of runners studying engineering at Purdue
University in West Lafayette, IN. We created runnDAILY for other runners.
runnDAILY has been in development for nearly 6 months, evolving drastically from
the project we originally set out to create.</p>

<h5>Why runnDAILY?</h5>
<p>While training in the past, we struggled to find a web site that offered
all the features we wanted and needed. We sought out to develop a site that
could handle the complexities that runners face while training. We wanted a site
that managed training data as well as it mapped routes. We wanted a mapping
interface that was intuitive, easy to use, and free from clutter. We wanted a
site that was developed on a social network with strong community interaction.
We wanted a site that took advantage of the latest internet techonologies to
deliver content in a effective manner. <span class="bold">We wanted
runnDAILY, and we think you do, too!</span></p>

<h5>runnDAILY's Promise</h5>
<p>We promise that we will NEVER include ads on ANY page. While we
understand the need to promote the community and spread knowledge about products
and events, ads are not the solution. Ads are distracting and subtract from the
overall site experience. runnDAILY is meant to be enjoyed for free, and not at
the cost of visual distractions. Also, runnDAILY will ALWAYS be available for
free. In the coming weeks, however, we will introduce premium features for users
interested in an enhanced site experience. Finally, we promise to be open to
feedback. Tell us what you really want! If we like your ideas, you will see them
on runnDAILY as soon as we can implement them.</p>
