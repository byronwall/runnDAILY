<h1>about Runn Daily</h1>

<h2>who we are</h2>
<p>
This site was created by a pair of runners for other runners.  
As we trained in the past, we struggled to find a web site that offered all the features we wanted. 
We wanted a site that handled all the complexities that runners really face.
We wanted a site that managed training data as well as it mapped runs.
We wanted a mapping interface that was simple, easy to use, and not cluttered.
We wanted a site that had a social component to it.  Running is too often a multi-person event, and we want to capture those details.
We wanted a site that used the newest internet techonologies to deliver our content in a convenient manner.
</p> 

<h2>why we made it</h2>
<p>
The site we wanted did not exist, and that is why we created Runn Daily.
Runn Daily is the running web site that has the feautres we wanted.
We figured if we wanted these features, other runners probably do as well.
This site has been months in the making.
</p>

<h2>our promises</h2>
<p>
We promise this site will never have ads.
They are distracting and almost never useful.
This site will always be available for free.
At some point we will come up with premium features for people who want them.
Finally, we promise to be open to feedback.
Tell us what you really want.  If we like it, then you will see it soon.
